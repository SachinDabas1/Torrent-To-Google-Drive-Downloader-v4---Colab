## Features

* Mounts your Google Drive within the Colab environment.
* Installs the `aria2c` command-line download utility.
* Downloads torrents using either magnet links or `.torrent` files.
* Saves downloaded files directly to a specified folder in your Google Drive.
* Provides cleaner, real-time download progress updates (Speed, ETA, Size).
* Configured to stop seeding immediately after download (`--seed-time=0`) to conserve resources.

## Requirements

* A Google Account (for Google Drive and Google Colab).
* A web browser to run Google Colab.

## How to Use

1.  **Obtain the Notebook:** Download the `.ipynb` file from this repository.
2.  **Open in Google Colab:**
    * Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    * Click `File` -> `Upload notebook...` and select the downloaded `.ipynb` file.
3.  **Run Cell 1: Mount Google Drive:**
    * Execute the first code cell.
    * Follow the prompts to authorize Colab to access your Google Drive. Ensure it mounts successfully.
4.  **Run Cell 2: Install aria2c:**
    * Execute the second code cell. This will install the necessary download tool within the Colab environment for this session.
5.  **Configure and Run Cell 3: Download Torrent:**
    * **Crucially, edit the `source_input` variable:**
        * Replace `"YOUR_MAGNET_LINK_HERE"` with the actual magnet link you want to use.
        * *Alternatively*, if using a `.torrent` file:
            * Upload the `.torrent` file to your Colab session's file browser (left sidebar, folder icon) or to your Google Drive.
            * Comment out the magnet link line.
            * Uncomment the line `# source_input = '/content/your_file.torrent'` and replace `/content/your_file.torrent` with the correct path to your uploaded file (e.g., `/content/drive/MyDrive/my_torrent.torrent` if it's in Drive).
    * **(Optional) Modify `drive_save_folder`:** Change the value `'Torrents_aria2'` if you want to save downloads to a different folder name within your Google Drive's "My Drive". The script will create this folder if it doesn't exist.
    * Execute the third cell.
6.  **Monitor Download:** The cell will output the download progress. Wait for it to show "Download complete" or "aria2c finished successfully."
7.  **Access Files:** Check the specified save folder in your Google Drive for the downloaded content.

## Important Notes

* **Seeding:** This script is configured with `--seed-time=0` to stop seeding immediately after the download finishes. This is done to save Colab resources and potentially avoid issues with tracker communication from Colab's IPs.
* **Errors:** If `aria2c` exits with an error code, check the output log in Cell 3 for details. Common errors include invalid magnet links/torrent files, tracker issues, or lack of peers.
* **Session Lifetime:** Colab notebooks have time limits for execution and idle time. Very long downloads might be interrupted.
